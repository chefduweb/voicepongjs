# VoicePong JS

A javascript version of the [Flash Live Audio Controller](https://github.com/jankeesvw/flashliveaudiocontroller), done completely with WebAudio.
For the pong game to work you need two mics, one on the input's left channel and one on the right channel.

Currently this version only works in Chrome.
